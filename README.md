seeping
=======

Simple project for visualizing ping results over time. Let's you "see" ping. Get it?

Using
-----
Compile and run the script like so:

    ./run.sh ip_address

Also, you can symlink to the script and use it that way.

    ln -s $(pwd)/run.sh ~/bin/seeping

The first time you run the script, it can take a while to download all the Java
and Scala dependencies.
